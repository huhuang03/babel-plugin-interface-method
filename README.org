What I want is translate interface with method to interface with const with method.

Yes, now I think it's very hard, and I will quit maybe.

#+BEGIN_SRC ts
interface Foo {
    bar: number;
    hello() {
        console.log(`thiz.bar`);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

to

#+BEGIN_SRC ts
export interface Foo {
    bar: number;
}
export const FooMethod {
    hello: (thiz: Foo) => {
        console.log(`thiz.bar`);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

* TODOS
** webstorm
   If the idea use eslint to check the interface. Should I also write an eslint config too?

   After read some eslint-config plugin source code, I didn't see code that add new grammar, can really do this?

** other

Follow the guide, seems we need build babel which I thing output of my knowledge.

Stop because we seems can't build babel-parser for now.

- how the babel with ts?
